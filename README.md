# Wealth

Wealth is a JavaScript library for handling money calculation, allocation, formatting, serialization, and currency handling.

There are many libraries out there that handle money or currency, but there's not one that offers a complete feature set.
This library provides a uniform interface for various money-related operations.

Under the hood, it uses [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/) for calculations.

## Installation
`npm install wealth`

or

`yarn add wealth`
